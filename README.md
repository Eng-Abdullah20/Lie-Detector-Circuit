# Lie-Detector-Circuit
This Repository is for a lie detector circuit using multisim
This circuit is built using multisim software. The circuit consists of 3 bipolar junction transistors BC547BG, red LED, green LED, and resistors. This circuit is a simple circuit, which can detect whether a person is lying or not. One method of telling a person is lying is by examining whether his hands are sweaty or dry, and this is the method incorporated in the design. The person subject to the lie detection test will hold to two wires, which are connected to the circuit to test whether he is lying or telling the truth. If the subject hands are sweating (probably telling a lie), a red LED starts flashing. That indicates that the person is lying. On the contrary, if the green LED flashes, that indicates the person is telling the truth.
